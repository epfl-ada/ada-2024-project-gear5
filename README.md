## Abstract


## Research questions
1. What were some of the "golden ages" of cinema through the years? (sorted by movie genre and country)
2. What caused the success and the downfall of these "golden ages"? Can the success of certain genres be traced back to single movies?
3. What are some of the main differences between these golden ages and the movie industry now?
4. Is it possible to predict the next cinema golden age?

## Additional datasets
