# Evolution of cinema through the years, finding the golden age.

## Abstract


## Research questions
1. What were some of the "golden ages" of cinema through the years? (sorted by movie genre and country)
2. What caused the success and the downfall of these "golden ages"? Can the success of certain genres be traced back to single movies?
3. What are some of the main differences between these golden ages and the movie industry now?
4. Is it possible to predict the next cinema golden age?

## Additional datasets
In addition to the original dataset, we are using the movielens dataset. This dataset gives us access to reviews and ratings for each movies. 


## Methods




## Proposed timeline
Week 9 -- 11/11 - 17/11: 
- Finding the additional datasets needed for the idea
- Combining the dataset and cleaning the data
- Have Proofs of conecepts for all the methods we want to use in the project
- Project P2 deadline

Week 10 -- 18/11 - 24/11: 
- Focus on Homework 2
- Running the sentiment analysis on the movie critics
- Defining the "sucess" metric and testing it on selected movies to see how weel it works

Week 11 -- 25/11 - 01/12: 
- Focus on Homework 2
- Finish the first part of the project
    - Timeseries analysis to find "golden ages"
    - Vizualisation of the results found

Week 12 -- 02/12 - 08/12: 
- Data vizualisation for second part
- Using predictive models on the timeseries for part 3

Week 13 -- 09/12 - 15/12: 
- Start writing the story. Will need to complete work done with more vizualisations

Week 14 -- 16/12 - 20/12: 
- Project P3 deadline
    - Finish the story we want to tell
